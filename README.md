# Brain tumor classification and segmentation, ENGS 106 final project
## UNet
Trained for 20 epochs with 32 batch size. Used the dice coeffecient and dice loss to determine how much do the ground-truth and the predicted masks overlab. Training for more epochs is eventually going to lead to more accurate segmentation of the tumors.
